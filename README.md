# pyetry_scraper
A webscraper to collect poetry by a poet of your choosing

The purpose is to have a generic structure with a scraper specific to the site it reads from. This way more scrapers can be added for other poetry sites.

TODO:
  Add scrapers for other poetry sites
  Filter out duplicates found across sites
